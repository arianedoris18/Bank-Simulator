# Bank-Simulator
A C++ program that simulates a simple banking system by managing employees, customers, and processing deposits and withdrawals with updated account balances.



## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to:  
- Parse structured input using `cin`/`scanf` and file redirection.  
- Store data in **structures** and manage them with arrays.  
- Process transactions (deposits and withdrawals).  
- Update customer balances dynamically.  
- Display formatted transaction results.  

The program reads employees, customers, and transaction data, then updates account balances accordingly while printing detailed transaction information.
